    👋 WELCOME
</h1>

<p>
    Hey, I am Oliwier and I have been into programming for 4 years. Currently, I am contributing to public and private projects as a front-end developer, but I really like working with <code>discord.js</code>, and <code>@minecraft/server</code> modules.
</p>

<p>
    Most of my projects are using TypeScript, because that's the language I use every day and I really love this language. This doesn't mean I haven't tried out other languages, because I worked in the past with Python, raw JavaScript before I learned TypeScript, and a bit of Java and C++.
